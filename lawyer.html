<p>This is an opportunity.</p>
<p>We have space for five lawyers, per legal service, per city (E.g., five spots to advertise simple wills in Saint John). If you are a lawyer in Fredericton, Saint John, or Moncton and would like to be considered, please fill out the form below.</p>
<p>Please also note that we are from the Maritimes. We have the utmost respect for our legal community. We want to provide consumers with greater convenience, and maintain the class and integrity of the legal profession. Unfortunately, these kinds of innovations have begun across North America and appear inevitable. This is a chance to start it here. This is a chance to work with locals. This is an opportunity. We would really appreciate your support.</p>

<h1>FAQ</h1>
<p><strong>How does it work?</strong><br> Customers can look at short bios and prices. They pick the lawyer they want for the service they want. We send you an email with their contact information and the service they want. You have 48 hours to contact them.</p>
<p><strong>What if I can’t get back to clients within 48 hours, or am too busy to accept more work?</strong><br> No problem. Send us an email, and we will put a “pause” on people being able to request your service.</p>
<p><strong>Can I change the price after I talk to the client?</strong><br> Yes. Unexpected situations warrant price changes. We will make absolutely sure that customers understand that flat fee rates are always for very circumscribed services. We will prepare them for price fluctuations should they reveal unexpected complexity.</p>
<p><strong>Will the website post client feedback about me?</strong><br> Never. It is very important that the general public maintain trust in our community of legal professionals. We will prompt customers for feedback about their experience and will keep that information confidential. If less than 90% of clients recommend someone, we will survey the legal community to see who else might like to post services.</p>
<p><strong>Can we post as a firm?</strong><br> No. We believe the law remains a relationship-based profession founded on personal trust and confidence. Only individual lawyers will be listed, though you may mention your firm association in your biography.</p>
<p><strong>What services will be listed?</strong><br> We are focused on personal services, and will consider posting additional practice areas in the future. For the moment, please restrict your submissions to as many non-business related flat fee services as you would like (e.g. simple wills, residential real estate purchase, uncontested divorce). </p>
<p><strong>When will the website launch?</strong><br> January 2016 in New Brunswick.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the price to post?</strong><br> No cost for the first 4 months. Then the price will be determined through consultation with participating lawyers.</p>
<p><strong>How detailed should I be when filling out the forms?</strong><br> Not detailed. This is just to help us choose the initial 5 lawyers, per service, per city. We will consult with participating lawyers to agree on uniform circumscriptions for each service prior to launching the website.</p>
<p><strong>How will you choose the initial participants?</strong><br> We would like to offer customers variety, without overwhelming them. We are looking for various levels of expertise and price point. Most importantly we’d love participants who are willing to work with us to make this an exceptional experience for both customers and lawyers.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any other benefits to participating?</strong><br> Yes. We will prompt site visitors with more complicated legal problems to fill out forms and consent to us circulating the description of their issue to participating lawyers.</p>
